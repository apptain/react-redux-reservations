React Redux Exmple
-------------------------------

**Requires**
meteor

**Use**
cd meteor
npm i

test - npm run test
app (needs work still) - npm start

**Explanation**

Some recent review of CouchDB and RabbitMQ have caused me to re-evaluate
some approaches and begin to lay some ground work for a system that
can initiate workflows, even offline, as well as completing this apps
original goal of a templated master detail view system.


**To do**
Start and finish red/greening reducer tests
Get meteor subscriptions working in container for now, but move to actions/reducers shortly
Use multi-action-api-middleware temporarily with queried action, will use in future for rollbar logging
